# Algorithms

* stable algorithm - 2 equal items remain in the same order as they were after sorting
* in-place algorithm - transforms input without any auxiliary data structures. small amount of extra storage space is allowed for variables. e.g input is overwritten via swapping or replacing.
* out-of-place algorithm - opposite
* comparison algorithm - only reads a list of elements through a single abstract comparison operation e.g less than, equal to


## Greedy Algorithm

*  attempts to find the solution in small steps locally hoping to find a solution that can be applied globally
*  often greedy algorithms will give the most optimal solution by making the decision that looks best atm. this isn't always the case in real world
*  kind of like bottom up approach

## Search algorithms

### Linear search

* e.g `indexOf()`, `includes()`, `find()`, `findIndex()`
* simply loops over every element
* time complexity O(1) to O(n) depending on the location of the element
* space complexity O(1) cause its in-place

### Breadth First Search

* looks at all the nodes at a given depth before moving further in depth


### Depth First Search
